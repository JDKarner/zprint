# zprint
print zpl in your downloads folder to a ups zp450

add paths to the .desktop file, then move that file to an appropriate location so you can access it easily.

Intended operation is to use your app launcher hotkey (typically super) and type in zprint, pinning to a dock would work as well.
This will print and delete any .zpl file in your downloads folder. Modification will need to be done to run it with printers other than zebra zp450.


This code originated in a script written by chatgpt, that was then converted to rust with the use of chatgpt.
